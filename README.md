# python-test
Mood ring for your words.


These questions should all be answered in this file:

How do I set this up?
Do I need to create a virtualenv, install dependencies, run django? (pipenv or requirements.txt are good options)
Or are you going to provide a virtualenv with everything installed and I just activate and run?
What is this app?
What are the endpoints and what can I send to them? 
Are there tests I can run?
If so, how can I run them (ie, pytest vs django tests. how did you run them?)

Code notes

Under polls why is there test & tests? I would move them to the 
Missing imports in test. Once you fix this, make sure all the tests can run. 
Please fix all the style issues (PyCharm is warning you about them)
